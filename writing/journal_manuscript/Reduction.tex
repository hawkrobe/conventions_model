%If our lexical priors -- our global conventions -- serve as a source of stability in meaning over longer timescales, then what accounts for our extraordinary flexibility  over short timescales? How do we coordinate on efficient local conventions, or \emph{conceptual pacts}, for talking about things we've never talked about before? In this section, we review the dynamics of coordination within repeated reference games and explore the possibility, formalized in Chapter 2, that rapid adaptation can be understood in a Bayesian modeling framework as lexical inference given partner-specific data.%: $P(\mathcal{L}_i | D_i, \Theta)$. 

We begin with the phenomenon of increasing efficiency in repeated reference games: speakers use detailed descriptions at the outset but converge to increasingly compressed shorthand while remaining understandable to their partner.
While this phenomenon has been extensively documented, to the point of serving as a proxy for measuring common ground, it has continued to pose a challenge for computational models of language use.
One simple explanation --- that it is merely an effect of familiarity or repetition on the part of the speaker, not related to \emph{ad hoc} conventions --- can be easily dismissed. 
When participants are asked to repeatedly refer to the same targets for a \emph{hypothetical} partner, no decrease in utterance length is found; in some cases utterances actually get longer \cite{HupetChantraine92_CollaborationOrRepitition}. 
This control experiment suggests that whatever is changing must be a result of the \emph{interaction} between partners.

It is also not clear how increasing efficiency could be explained by the lower-level alignment mechanisms proposed in \emph{interactive alignment} accounts \cite{pickering2004toward, pickering2006alignment, garrod2009joint}.
According to these accounts, coordination on meaning proceeds primarily through automatic priming at lower levels of representation.
While low-level priming is certainly possible in repeated reference tasks, especially when listeners engage in extensive dialogue or alternate in the speaker role, it is not clear why priming would favor some words in a long referring expression over others, or lead to increasing efficiency.
Furthermore, priming alone cannot explain why speakers still converge to more efficient labels even when the listener is prevented from saying anything at all and only indirect feedback about the listener's response accuracy is provided \cite{KraussWeinheimer66_Tangrams}; conversely, speakers continue using longer descriptions given non-verbal evidence of errors \cite{hawkins2020characterizing}.
In these cases, there are no linguistic features available for priming or alignment.
Explaining when and why speakers believe that shorter descriptions will suffice requires a mechanism for coordination on meaning even given sparser, non-verbal feedback.

Finally, we consider agent-based models implementing simple update rules \cite{steels_self-organizing_1995,barr_establishing_2004,young_evolution_2015}.
These models all share some mechanism that makes utterances more likely to be produced after communicative successes and less likely after communicative failures, as in Roth-Erev reinforcement learning \cite{erev1998predicting}.
While this form of reinforcement is a powerful mechanism for allowing groups to reach consensus, it is not clear why an agent using such rules would initially prefer to produce longer utterances, or how reinforcing initially long descriptions could lead to reduction. % without some mechanism for \emph{credit assignment} to the component words.
When reduction has been investigated in these models (e.g. as in the phenomenon of phonological erosion), the process has simply been hard-coded as an $\epsilon$ probability of speakers dropping a token \cite{beuls2013agent,steels2016agent}.

In this section, we argue that our Bayesian account provides a natural computational explanation for increasing efficiency in terms of the inferences made by speakers.
Given that this phenomenon arises in purely dyadic settings, it also provides an opportunity to explore more basic properties of the first two capacities formalized in our model (\emph{uncertainty} and \emph{partner-specific learning}) before introducing the fully hierarchical component in later sections. 
In brief, we show that increasing efficiency emerges from the Gricean maxim of quantity, as formalized in the speaker's tradeoff between informativity and parsimony (Eq.~\ref{eq:marginalized}), under shifts in their uncertainty about the listener's language model. 
For novel, ambiguous objects like tangrams, where speakers do not expect strong referential conventions to be shared, longer initial descriptions are motivated by high initial uncertainty in the speaker's lexical prior $P(\phi_k | \Theta)$. 
Combining multiple partially redundant descriptors hedges against the possibility that particular meanings are not shared by the listener.
As the interaction goes on, the speaker obtains feedback $D_k$ from the listener responses and updates their posterior beliefs $P(\phi_k | D_k)$ accordingly. 
As uncertainty gradually decreases, they are able to achieve the same expected informativity with shorter, more efficient messages.

\end{figure*}


We build up to our explanation of increasing efficiency by first exploring a simpler simulation.
This first simulation demonstrates the most fundamental desideratum for any model of \emph{ad hoc} coordination: agents equipped with our inferential machinery are able to coordinate on a communication system in the absence of shared priors. 
We consider the simplest possible reference game with two objects, $\mathcal{O} = \{o_1, o_2\}$, where the speaker must choose between two one-word utterances $\mathcal{U} = \{u_1, u_2\}$ with equal production cost. 

To define the agents' initial lexical prior $P(\phi)$ over the expected meanings of each utterance, we must first say what representation we are using for the agents' lexicon $\mathcal{L}_{\phi}$.
For simplicity, we follow prior Bayesian models of word learning \cite<e.g.>{XuTenenbaum07_WordLearningBayesian} and represent the space of meanings for an utterance as the set of nodes in a concept taxonomy\footnote{There are many alternative representational choices compatible with our core model, including parameterized vector embeddings and multi-layer neural networks, which may be more appropriate for scaling our model to larger spaces of words and referents. We return to these possibilities in the General Discussion.}.
When objects are conceptually distinct, as assumed in most prior models of signaling games, this taxonomy is flat and the target space of utterance meanings is simply equivalent to the space of individual objects, i.e.~$\den{u}_{\phi} = \phi(u) \in \mathcal{O}$ for all $u\in\mathcal{U}$. 
Then the lexical meaning function is defined to be
$$
\mathcal{L}_\phi(o,u) = \left\{ \begin{array} {rl} 1 & \textrm{if $\phi(u)=o$} \\ 0 & \textrm{otherwise} \end{array}\right.
$$
To explore pure coordination, we initialize agents with uniform priors: $$\phi(u_i) \sim \textrm{unif}\{o_1, o_2\}$$ for all $u_i \in \mathcal{U}$.

The first step of the interaction proceeds as follows.
Suppose the target object on the first round is $o_1$.
Due to uniform priors, both utterances are equally likely to apply to either object. 
And because each utterance is equally (un)informative, the speaker effectively samples an utterance at random $u~\sim~S(u|o_1)$.
Suppose it is $u_1$.
They may then observe the listener's selection of an object $o \sim L(o | u_1)$ --- say, $o_1$, a correct response.
Finally, they may use the observed pair $D = \{u_1, o_1\}$ to update their beliefs about the listener's true lexicon $P(\phi | D)\propto L_1(o_1 | u_1, \phi)P(\phi)$.
The listener is similarly able to update their beliefs about the speaker's true lexicon $P(\phi | D)\propto S_1(u_1 | o_1, \phi)P(\phi)$. 
Both agents then proceed to the next trial, where they use this posterior distribution to produce or interpret language.

To examine how the dynamics of this process unfold over multiple rounds, we conducted a simulation running these speaker and listener models forward.
We have the agents swap speaker and listener roles on each trial, and randomly sample the target on each trial from the set of $\{o_1, o_2\}$.
We use enumeration to exactly compute each agent's posterior beliefs about $\phi$ at each time step.
We simulated 1000 trajectories, each of which was 30 trials in length; because there are two possible targets, we group these into blocks of length two.
These trajectories all initialized the agents with the same uncertainty, and diverged only when different actions are sampled at a time step.
For example, if the speaker samples $u_2$ instead of $u_1$ on the first trial, or if the listener makes an error by choosing $o_2$, then they will subsequently condition on these observations instead, leading to different downstream beliefs and behavior.


We highlight several key results from these simulations.
First, most fundamentally, the communicative success of the dyad rises over the course of interaction; the listener is able to more accurately select the true target object (see Fig.~\ref{fig:sec1model}A). 
Second, the initial symmetry between the meanings is broken by initial choices, leading to \emph{arbitrary} but \emph{stable} mappings in future rounds.
This can be seen by examining the path-dependence of beliefs, following all possible outcomes of the initial trial (see Fig.~\ref{fig:path-dependence}). 
Third, because each agent assumes their partner is using language cooperatively, they also make inferences about \emph{unheard} utterances. 
Observing $D = \{(u_2, o_1)\}$ also provides evidence that $u_1$ is \emph{not} a good fit for $o_1$ (e.g.~see the third row of Fig.~\ref{fig:path-dependence}).
This effect arises from Gricean pragmatic reasoning: if $u_2$ were a better fit for $o_1$, the listener assumes the speaker would have used it instead. 
%Fourth, conventions may form based on \emph{failed references} as well as successful ones: if the speaker intends $o_1$ and says $u_1$, but then the listener incorrectly picks $o_2$, the speaker will take this as evidence that $u_1$ actually means $o_2$ in their partner's lexicon and become increasingly likely to use it that way on subsequent rounds.
These simulations were conducted at soft-max optimality parameter values $w_L = w_S = 16$ and memory discounting parameter $\beta = 0.8$, but see Appendix Fig.~\ref{fig:arbitrariness_grid} for an exploration of other values.

\subsection{Simulation 1.2: Efficiency}

\begin{figure*}
\centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1.5]{sec1-reduction_example}
    \vspace{1em}
  \caption{\emph{Schematic of speaker for first trial of Simulation 1.2.} The speaker begins with uncertainty about the meanings in the listener's lexicon (e.g. assigning 55\% probability to the possibility that utterance $u_1$ means object $o_1$.) A target $o_1$ is presented, and the speaker samples an utterance from the distribution $S(u|o_1)$. Finally, they observe the listener's response and update their beliefs. Due to the compositional semantics of the utterance $u_1u_2$, the speaker becomes increasingly confident that both component primitives, $u_1$ and $u_2$, apply to object $o_1$ in their partner's lexicon.}
  \label{fig:sec1efficiency}
\end{figure*}

Next, we show how our inferential model explains speakers' gains in efficiency over multiple interactions. 
For efficiency to change at all, speakers must be able to produce utterances that vary in length. 
For this simulation, we therefore extend the grammar to allow for multi-word utterances by allowing speakers to combine together multiple primitive utterances with conjunctions.
Specifically, we consider a scenario with the same two objects as in Simulation 1.1, but giving the speaker four primitive utterances $\{u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4\}$ instead of only two. 
Critically, the meaning of longer utterances are derived compositionally from these primitives using the product $t$-norm\footnote{We focus on conjunction as one of the simplest operations to construct longer, non-atomic utterances from primitives. See also \citeA{SteinertThrelkeld16_CompositionalSignaling} who consider the operation of negation.}:
$$\mathcal{L}_\phi(u_iu_j, o) = \mathcal{L}_\phi(u_i, o) \times \mathcal{L}_\phi(u_j, o)$$


While we established in the previous section that successful \emph{ad hoc} conventions can emerge even in a state of pure uncertainty, human participants in repeated reference games typically bring some prior expectations about language into the interaction.
For example, a participant who hears `ice skater' on the first round of a task with tangram stimuli may be more likely to select some objects more than others while still having substantial uncertainty about the intended target.
This observation is key to understanding why speakers may initially use longer utterances in repeated reference games with ambiguous stimuli. 
Under a completely uniform prior, where all words are expected to be equally meaningless to one's partner, longer utterances have no additional value. 
Under a completely concentrated prior, where there already exists a strong convention for a short label, that label would suffice and a longer utterances is redundant.
We thus initialize both agents with weak lexical beliefs
$$P(\phi(u_1) = o_1) = P(\phi(u_2) = o_1) = 0.55$$ 
$$P(\phi(u_3) = o_1) = P(\phi(u_4) = o_1) = 0.45$$
and show how our model predicts an initial preferences for long utterances but increasing preferences for shorter utterances given communicative success.

As the speaker observes several successful interactions, it updates its beliefs and becomes more confident about the meanings of the component lexical items $u_1$ and $u_2$. As a result, more efficient single-word utterances gradually gain in utility as cost begins to dominate the utility. On trial 5, $u_1$ is sampled, breaking the symmetry between utterances.}
  \label{fig:sec1internals}
\end{figure*}

As in Simulation 1.1, we simulated 1000 trajectories of dyadic interaction between agents.
Target objects were randomly sampled on each trial, agents swapped roles, and the agents' lexical posteriors $P(\phi | D)$ were computed after each trial using exact enumeration. 
Utterance cost is defined to be the number of `words' in an utterance, so $c(u_1) =1$ and $c(u_1u_2)=2$.
Results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sec1model}B.
As in repeated reference games between human participants (e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:clark92}), our speaker agent initially prefers longer utterance (mean length $\approx 1.5$ on first block) but rapidly converges to shorter utterances after several repetitions (mean length $\approx 1$ on final block).

To illustrate in detail how our model derives this phenomenon as a consequence of rational inference, we walk step-by-step through a single trial (Fig. \ref{fig:sec1efficiency}).
Consider a speaker who wants to refer to object $o_1$. 
They expect their partner to be slightly more likely to interpret their language using a lexicon in which $u_{1}$ and $u_{2}$ apply to this object, due to their weak initial biases. 
However, there is still a reasonable chance ($p=0.45$) that either $u_1$ or $u_2$ alone will be interpreted to mean $o_2$ by their partner, which would lead to an incorrect response. 
Thus, it is more informative to produce the conjunction $u_{1}u_{2}$ to hedge against this possibility, despite its higher production cost. 

To see why this is the case, consider the expected informativity of the utterance under different possible listener lexicons.
The possibility with highest probability is that both $u_1$ and $u_2$ will mean $o_1$ in the listener's lexicon ($p = 0.55^2 \approx 0.3$), in which case the listener will correctly identify the target with high probability.
The possibility that both $u_1$ and $u_2$ will mean $o_2$ in the listener's lexicon is only $p=0.45^2 \approx 0.2$, leading the listener to erroneously select $o_2$ with high probability. 
In the mixed cases, where just one of $u_1$ or $u_2$ means $o_2$ in the listener's lexicon ($p = 2 \cdot 0.45 * 0.55 \approx 0.5$), the listener will choose between the objects at chance, which yields an intermediate informativity.
When expected informativity is calculated across these outcomes, it is more valuable to produce the longer conjunction than the shorter component utterances.
Finally, upon observing the listener's response to the conjunction (say, $o_1$), the speaker becomes more confident that the component utterances $u_1$ and $u_2$ mean $o_1$ in their updated posterior over the listener's lexicon.
This credit assignment to individual lexical items is a consequence of the compositional meaning of longer utterances in our simple grammar.

Fig.~\ref{fig:sec1internals} shows the trajectories of internal components of the speaker utility as the interaction continues.
We assume for illustrative purposes that $o_1$ continues to be the target on each trial and the same agent continues to be the speaker.
As the posterior probability that individual primitive utterances $u_1$ and $u_2$ independently mean $o_1$ increases (far left), the marginal gap in informativity between the conjunction and the shorter components gradually decreases (center left).
As a consequence, production cost increasingly dominates the utility (center-right). 
After several trials of observing a successful listener response given the conjunction, the utility of the shorter utterances reaches parity with the conjunction.
Once the speaker samples a shorter utterance (e.g. $u_1$), the symmetry collapses and that utterance remains most probable in future rounds, allowing for a stable and efficient \emph{ad hoc} convention.
Thus, increasing efficiency is derived as a rational consequence of inference about the listener's lexical.
For these simulations, we used $w_S = w_L = 7, w_c = 11, \beta=0.8$ but the qualitative reduction effect is found over a range of different parameters (see Appendix Fig. \ref{fig:conjunction_grid}).

%Here we compare this model to several simpler baselines to establish which components of the model are necessary and sufficient for the desired behavior.

%In the limit, it doesn't matter whether you have pragmatics in both learning rule or decision rule. 
%In case where it's only in production rule, you'll produce the data with the necessary biases in learning.



\subsection{Discussion}

The explanation for increasing efficiency we have offered is consistent with some additional observations from prior empirical work.
For example, if participants reduce their lexical uncertainty over successive rounds, as we suggest, then we might expect a corresponding decrease in explicit markers of this uncertainty. 
Indeed, \citeA{BrennanClark96_ConceptualPactsConversation} counted \emph{hedges} across repetitions.
Hedges are expressions like \emph{sort of} or \emph{like}, and morphemes like \emph{-ish}, that explicitly mark uncertainty or provisionality, such as \emph{a car, sort of silvery purple colored} \cite{BrennanClark96_ConceptualPactsConversation,Fraser10_Hedging,MedlockBriscoe07_HedgeClassification}.
\citeA{BrennanClark96_ConceptualPactsConversation} found a much greater occurrence of hedges on the first round than the final round (26\% and 2\%, respectively).
Additionally, very few hedges were found on early trials in less ambiguous contexts (e.g. referring to a shoe in the context of dogs and fish), lending support for the specific use of hedges to mark uncertainty rather than a generic social use when first beginning to talk with a new partner.

While we have already discussed the limitations of the simple reinforcement learning models proposed in prior work -- namely, that a successful response only reinforces the longer utterance -- it is plausible that model-based reinforcement learning using more sophisticated architectures could predict similar patterns of increasing efficiency.
For instance, architectures that appropriately incorporate compositionality and recurrence into the speaker's production model may be able to implicitly ground shorter utterances in the shared history \cite<e.g>{hawkins2019continual}.
However, such an architecture would be much closer to a re-implementation of our inferential model than the model-free agents in the existing literature.
We return to this issue in our discussion of the scalability of our model in the General Discussion.

Finally, our simulations in this section are consistent with recent analyses of exactly \emph{what} gets reduced \cite{hawkins2020characterizing}.
That is, is the speaker adopting a fragment shorthand by randomly and noisily dropping words, or are they simplifying or narrowing their descriptions to names by systematically omitting redundant details?
Closed-class parts of speech like determiners and prepositions are empirically much more likely to be dropped than open-class parts of speech like adjectives and nouns, and entire modifying clauses are more likely to be dropped together than expected by random corruption.
This observation accords with early hand-tagged analyses by \citeA{Carroll80_NamingHedges}, which found that in three-quarters of transcripts from \citeA{krauss_changes_1964} the short names that participants converged upon were prominent in some syntactic construction at the beginning, often as a head noun that was initially modified or qualified by other information. 
While our simulation only considered two-word conjunctions with equal (weak) uncertainty, it is likely that the semantic components of real initial descriptions have more heterogeneous uncertainty in the initial lexical prior.
Thus, asymmetries in reduction may be attributable to the lexical priors associated with different attributes of the target.
